These strategies and how they will be implemented should be described in awardee?s CAP.

Specifically, applicants are required to target special efforts toward priority populations at disproportionate risk for chronic diseases or conditions.  All Americans should have equal opportunities to make healthy choices that allow them to live long, healthy lives, regardless of their income, education, race/ethnic background, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other factors.  Health disparities represent preventable differences in the burden of disease, disability, injury or violence, or in opportunities to achieve optimal health.  Recipients will describe the intervention population selected, including relevant health disparities, and how selected interventions will improve health and reduce or eliminate one or more identified health disparities.\n\nAll activities supported through this FOA must contribute to area-wide health improvements and reductions in health disparities and should be based on a robust analysis of area health burden overall and across population subgroups (population subgroups may be defined by factors such as race or ethnicity, gender, age [e.g., youth, the elderly], education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation, among others).\n In addition, awardees are expected to routinely communicate to partners, the public, decision makers, and key stakeholders about the work funded under this FOA, and disseminate the results of their work to decision makers and the public, as appropriate.

Immunosuppressive regimens typically include a combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), an antiproliferative agent (mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium, or azathioprine), and corticosteroids. Proliferation signal inhibitors, e.g., sirolimus, may also be used either in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor or antiproliferative agent, or as a replacement for one. Availability of generic versions for these immunosuppressants allows for reduced drug costs that translate to increased drug access and significant cost savings for both insurers and patients. \n\nMaintenance of the immunosuppressive balance is critical for allograft patency, minimization of adverse effects, and ultimately long-term survival of solid organ transplant recipients. The question whether the brand to generic switch or switch among multiple generic products may introduce clinically relevant changes in drug exposure and thus affect acute rejection, adverse events, and long term graft survival remains debated in transplant community.  To address transplant community?s concern, FDA funded research studies to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of approved generic tacrolimus capsules to Prograf (brand product) in stable liver and kidney adult transplant patients with moderate and high immunological risk. However, the impact of introduction of generic immunosuppressants on long term graft survival was never systematically evaluated.   These clinical outcome studies are critically needed to confirm the therapeutic equivalence of generic immunosuppressants with the brand product, thereby increasing transplant community confidence on the use of generic immunosuppressants.  \n\nObjectives:\nThe objective of this study is to conduct a retrospective analysis about the impact of generic immunosuppressants on short term acute rejection and long term patient graft survival since the introduction of generic immunosuppressants. The outcome of this study will help respond to public concerns regarding the interchangeability of generic immunosuppressants and improve review practices of generic immunosuppressants if necessary. The retrospective analysis will also aid in the design of prospective studies to investigate generic substitution for immunosuppressants.\n\nDetailed Descriptions:\nThe model drugs to be studied should include at least cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and mycophenolate sodium. \n\nThe project may include the following:\n\n1.  Conduct a multi-center retrospective analysis of kidney, heart, liver transplant recipients using any model drug listed above.  Data including demographic, immunosuppressive medications (drug, brand/generic, single/multiple generic), dosage level and adjustment, transplant organ function, acute rejection, renal/liver biopsy results and others should be collected from clinical databases, electronic medical records or other relevant databases.\n\n2.  Evaluate patient adherence to their immunosuppressant therapy\n\n3.  Perform acute rejection and long-term survival analysis (e.g., 1, 3, 5 or 10-year survival) of patients taking brand immunosuppresants only, generic immunosuppressants only, or both brand and generic immunosuppressants. Further subgroup analysis in children, adults, and African Americans is recommended.\n\n4.  Analyze other factors such as donor-, transplant-, and patient-related risk factors which may potentially affect long-term survival of patients.\n\n", "office": "Food &amp; Drug Administration", "listing_url": "http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=254080", "posted_dt": "2014-04-18T00:00:00Z", "solnbr": "RFA-FD-14-021", "title": "Retrospective Analysis on the Impact of Generic Immunosuppressants on Acute Rejection and Long Term Graft Survivals (U01)", "data_source": "grants.gov", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services"}, "_type": "opp", "_index": "fbopen0"}

Other acts, such as assault, with or without weapons, can lead to serious injury or death. The consequences of youth gang and gun violence are visible and immediate and are felt by citizens nationwide.  \n\nLikewise, exposure to violence that children and youth experience in their homes, schools, or communities harms citizens and communities. Without support and intervention, such exposure can impair children?s cognitive and emotional development, keep them from healing, lead to later serious health issues, and may perpetuate the cycle of violence.\n\nAt the direction of President Obama, the Departments of Justice and Education launched the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention (Forum) to begin a national conversation concerning youth and gang violence and prevention, raise awareness, and elevate the issue to national significance. To enhance these efforts, the federal government supports Forum cities as they align and coordinate existing resources, engage in community outreach, develop and maintain strong collaboratives, and increase the engagement of youth, the faith community, law enforcement, victim services, and other key partners in their efforts.  \n\nSuccessful applicants will become part of a national movement and a network and learning community of cities working to stem youth violence and improve the wellbeing of children and youth.  \n\nOJJDP will competitively select as many as five new sites to join the Forum?s participating localities of Boston, Camden, Chicago, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Salinas, and San Jose.

Using an integrated ecosystem approach to manage MPAs requires consideration of multiple factors such as coastal and urban development, pollution, sustainability or fishing and tourism/recreation practices, and presence of invasive species. EBM involves two changes in the way management has traditionally been practiced: (1) each human activity is managed in the context of the multiple ways it may interact with marine and coastal ecosystems, and (2) multiple activities are managed for a common outcome. Through this approach, stakeholders -- including communities, private sector, legislators, policy makers, and marine conservationists -- are engaged in improving marine biodiversity. By the end of this activity: (1) EBM will be applied in targeted MPAs and (2) the methods and approaches piloted in those locations will be socialized and disseminated more broadly among relevant stakeholders.

Non-U.S. colleges and universities in countries that are ineligible for assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA) or related appropriations acts are ineligible. Universities that are part of the One Health Central and East Africa (OHCEA) or Southeast Asia One Health University Network (SEAOHUN) are ineligible because they are beneficiaries of the One Health Workforce project. (2) Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Qualified U.S. and non-U.S. private non-profit organizations may apply for USAID funding under this RFA. (3) For-Profit Organizations: Qualified U.S. and non-U.S. private for-profit organizations may apply for USAID funding under this RFA. Potential for-profit applicants should note that, pursuant to ADS 303.5(k) and 22 CFR 226.81, the payment of fee/profit to the prime recipient under grants and cooperative agreements is prohibited. However, if a prime recipient has a sub-contract with a for-profit organization for the acquisition of goods or services (i.e., if a buyer-seller relationship is created), fee/profit for the sub-contractor is authorized. (4) Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs): A local or indigenous PVO, which by definition is a non-U.S. PVO operating in the same foreign country in which it is organized, is eligible to receive funding. Local PVOs are not required to register with USAID. In accordance with 2 CFR 203, a U.S. PVO or an ?International PVO,&apos;&apos; which by definition is a non-U.S. PVO that performs development work in one or more countries other than the country in which it is domiciled, must be registered with USAID to be eligible to receive funding. For more information on registering with USAID as a PVO, please see: http://www.usaid.gov/pvo.

Each call will identify topics and contain a common cut-off date for proposal submission. Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).\r\nCalls for proposals (made by amendments to this BAA) will occur periodically throughout the life of this over-arching BAA. Each call will: (1) identify specific topic areas; (2) identify any changes to the standard evaluation criteria or proposal preparation instructions, and; (3) contain common cutoff dates for proposal submissions.It is anticipated that calls issued under this BAA will be unrestricted.

These editions publish historical records of national significance and may focus on the papers of major figures from American life or cover broad historical movements in politics, military, business, social reform, the arts, and other aspects of the national experience. The historical value of the records and their expected usefulness to broad audiences must justify the costs of the project.The goal of this program is to provide access to and editorial context for the historical documents and records that tell the American story.  The NHPRC encourages projects, whenever possible and appropriate, to provide access to these materials in a free and open online environment, without precluding other forms of publication.Grants are awarded for collecting, describing, preserving, compiling, editing, and publishing documentary source materials in print and online. Because of the focus on documentary sources, grants do not support preparation of critical editions of published works unless such works are just a small portion of the larger project.All applicants should be aware that the application process is highly competitive. Applicants from ongoing project must demonstrate that they have successfully achieved the performance objectives associated with previous NHPRC awards, provide updated, current information, including a description of the new activities, progress towards preparing the edition, and a justification of the new budget. If a currently-funded project is preparing only a print edition, they must either complete the project by 2018 or make plans to prepare an online edition by 2018. In the latter instance, projects may also prepare print editions as part of their overall publishing plan.  Print-only editions should contact the NHPRC staff for technical assistance in preparing an application.New projects and projects that have never received an NHPRC grant must include plans for an online edition and apply at the second deadline (December 4, 2014). Such projects may also prepare print editions as part of their overall publishing plan.For a comprehensive list of Commission&apos;s limitations on funding, please see What We Do and Do Not Fund.Award Information - Applicants may apply for funding for one year. Award amounts may range from $30,000 to $200,000. Depending on the availability of funding, the Commission expects to make as many as 25 grants in this category, for a total of up to $2,500,000. Grants begin no earlier than March 1, 2015.The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all publications, project websites and other products that result from its support.Eligibility Information - ?Nonprofit organizations or institutions ?Colleges, universities, and other academic institutions?State or local government agencies ?Federally-acknowledged or state-recognized ?Native American tribes or groups. Cost sharing is required. Cost sharing is the financial contribution the applicant pledges to the cost of a project. Cost sharing can include both direct and indirect expenses, in-kind contributions, non-Federal third-party contributions, and any income earned directly by the project. The Commission ordinarily provides no more than 50 per cent of total project costs for projects funding in the Publishing Historical Records in Documentary Editions category. Other Requirements - Applicant organizations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to submitting an application, maintain SAM registration throughout the application and award process, and include a valid DUNS number in their application. Details on SAM registration and requesting a DUNS number can be found at the System for Award Management website at http://sam.gov.

It inspires U.S. students, attracts talent from around the world, and drives critical intellectual and technological advances in other fields. It is entering an era of unprecedented potential as a result of new discoveries about matter and energy in the Universe. Particle Physics seeks to explore the fundamental nature of matter, energy, space, and time. It asks such questions as: What are the origins of mass? Can the basic forces of nature be unified? How did the universe begin? How will it evolve in the future? What are dark matter and dark energy? Are there extra dimensions of space-time? Formerly separate questions in cosmology (the universe on the largest scales) and quantum phenomena (the universe on the smallest scales) become connected through our understanding that the early universe can be explored through the techniques of particle physics. At the NSF, research related to particle physics is supported by four programs within the Division of Physics: (1) the Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics Program; (2) the Theoretical Particle Astrophysics/Cosmology Program; (3) the Experimental Elementary Particle Physics (EPP) Program, which supports particle physics at accelerators; and (4) the Experimental Particle Astrophysics (PA) Program, which supports non-accelerator experiments.The Particle Astrophysics program supports university research in many areas of particle astrophysics, including the study of ultra-high energy particles reaching Earth from beyond our atmosphere, experiments or research and development projects for underground facilities and non-accelerator-based experiments studying the properties of neutrinos. Currently supported activities include: ultra-high energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino studies; the study of solar, underground and reactor neutrino physics; neutrino mass measurements; searches for the direct and indirect detection of Dark Matter; searches for neutrino-less double beta decay; and studies of Cosmology and Dark Energy. It should be noted that proposals that are submitted to the PA program and are requesting in excess of $1,000,000/year may, at the discretion of the Program Officer, be subjected to an additional level of scrutiny in the form of a cost review that would take place before the annual PA panel that meets to discuss all of the submitted proposals.", "agency": "National Science Foundation", "listing_url": "http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=242314", "posted_dt": "2013-09-11T00:00:00Z", "solnbr": "PD-13-1643", "title": "Particle Astrophysics", "data_source": "grants.gov"}, "_type": "opp", "_index": "fbopen0"}

Government information maintained by state archives is national assets, serving as important resources for documenting rights and capturing the national experience.  The NHPRC will support projects that actively engage in activities that preserve electronic record assets and make them available for public discovery. The Commission encourages collaborative projects that bring together multiple parties to plan for and carry out project goals and outcomes. The NHPRC strongly encourages applicants to leverage the resources resulting from the Council of State Archivists? State Electronic Records Initiative (SERI) to inform their work.  Projects in this program cannot digitize historical records. If you intend to digitize as part of processing, refer to the Access to Historical Records announcement; if you already have description and are looking to publish the digital surrogates, refer to the Digital Dissemination of Archival Collections announcement. In addition, projects cannot establish electronic document management systems that only manage born-digital records with limited retention periods. Applications requesting support for these activities will be considered ineligible in this program.  For a comprehensive list of Commission limitations on funding, please see What we do and do not fund. Award Information - A grant normally is for one to three years and up to $200,000. The Commission expects to make 3 or more grants in this category, for a total of up to $600,000. Grants begin no earlier than July 1, 2015.The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all products that result from its support. Cost sharing is required. It is the financial contribution the applicant pledges to the cost of a project.

The State child welfare agency that is responsible for the State plan under titles IV-B or IV-E of the Social Security Act must be included in the regional partnership. If the regional partnership consists of a county that is located in a State that is State-supervised and county-administered, the county child welfare agency satisfies this requirement. In such a partnership, the State agency that is ultimately responsible for State plan compliance under titles IV-B or IV-E is not required to be a partner in the regional partnership but is not precluded from participating as a member. In a State-administered system, a local office of the State child welfare agency can participate in the partnership and satisfy this requirement.\nAny member of the regional partnership is eligible to be a lead applicant provided that (1) the partner is one of the eligible entities described previously and (2) the member agency or organization has the capacity to sufficiently monitor program activities or services, funding, and reporting requirements described in the FOA. While either the State child welfare agency that is responsible for the State plan under titles IV-B or IV-E of the Social Security Act or an Indian Tribe or Tribal consortium must be a member of a regional partnership, it is NOT necessary that either of these entities serve as the lead agency.\nPer the legislative requirements, RPGs are required to select and report on performance indicators and evaluation measures to increase the knowledge that can be gained from the program. In 2012, the Children&amp;rsquo;s Bureau funded 17 RPGs, which are participating in the RPG national cross-site evaluation. Partnerships will:\n- Use specific, well-defined, and evidence-based programs that are also trauma-informed and targeted to the identified population;\n- Conduct an evaluation that is sufficiently rigorous to contribute to the evidence base on service delivery and outcomes associated with the project&apos;s chosen interventions;\n- Participate in the national cross-site evaluation, which includes an implementation and partnership study, an outcomes study, and an impact study.", "office": "Administration for Children and Families", "listing_url": "http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=253776", "posted_dt": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z", "solnbr": "HHS-2014-ACF-ACYF-CU-0809", "title": "Regional Partnership Grants to Increase the Well-Being of, and to Improve the Permanency Outcomes for, Children Affected by Substance Abuse", "data_source": "grants.gov", "agency": "Department of Health and Human Services"}, "_type": "opp", "_index": "fbopen0"}

Failure to maintain the Cold Probe in optimal operating order will eventually lead to a complete failure of the system, requiring more expensive repairs and/or replacement of expensive components of the probe and cryogenic system. Agilent Technologies, the manufacturer, is the only known source for repair and maintenance of this equipment. Agilent Technologies has the complete schematic diagrams, can supply factory authorized replacement parts and provide the proprietary software necessary for proper instrument operation.\r\nInterested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Purchasing Agent at the address stated above.

Description of Services: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. For more information on the MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.\r\nThe United States of America acting through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (\"MCC\") has formed partnerships with some of the world's poorest countries through large, five-year Grant Programs referred to as Compacts. MCC administers these Compacts through the Millennium Challenge Accounts (MCAs) which are entities that are set up locally to manage and oversee all aspects of the Compact implementation.MCC has approved over $7 Billion in Poverty Reduction Compacts worldwide that support country-determined projects in such sectors as:\u2022 agriculture and irrigation,\u2022 transportation (roads, bridges, ports),\u2022 water supply and sanitation,\u2022 access to health,\u2022 finance and enterprise development,\u2022 anticorruption initiatives,\u2022 land rights and access,\u2022 access to education\r\nA large part of MCC's portfolio is focused on the energy sector, which is expected to grow in the new Compacts that are being developed in several African countries-Ghana, Tanzania, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Niger.\r\nThe Procurement Practice Group, a unit within the Sector Operations Division of MCC's Department of Compact Operations, is committed to supporting MCC's mission by following the highest standards of professional public procurement of goods, services and works necessary for the effective development and implementation of our Compacts. Procurement efforts under the Compacts are conducted by the host country MCA entity using the MCC Program Procurement Guidelines (PPG) and standard bidding documents. The PPG are based on the World Bank procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents; MCC Compact-funded procurements are not conducted using the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). Procurements funded under the Compacts are managed by one or more Procurement Agents (PA) serving the MCA entity. The PA, which may be a government or an independent entity, works closely with the MCA entity to ensure that procurements are conducted in compliance with the MCC PPG. The staff of the Procurement Practice Group provides oversight of procurements executed by the MCAs to ensure that the procurement process meets the standards of fairness, quality and transparency. For more information on the MCC PPG, please visit www.mcc.gov/pages/business/guidelines. MCC's success in fulfilling its mission of poverty reduction through economic growth requires effective assessment and management of risks through a comprehensive approach to prevent delays during Compact implementation. Some of these risks are found in the procurement process. A key principle for a successful Compact is MCC's commitment to taking all reasonable steps to promote the best procurement approaches and best practices in its staff and that of its country counterparts, including providing training and keeping up to date with sector trends, the market and to be acquainted with how other agencies/donors manage their procurements, and promoting our country counterparts to do the same. MCC and MCA staff is required to work in partnership to ensure that the procurement processes are not only done according to PPG but also ensure that they are done using the most efficient process that mitigates risks of procurement delays, failed procurements and deficient contract implementation. Given that a good amount of MCC's financial investments are driven by procurement mechanisms it is critically important that this partnership works in a manner that demonstrates understanding of the current procurement trends being used in the market. Because of these reasons, it is necessary to hire a consultant that has specific procurement experience in this area to support MCC's Procurement Practice Group. 7.

Background\nEVH Procedure\nEVH stands for Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting. During a Coronary Bypass procedure, one or more healthy blood vessels will be taken (or \"harvested\") from the patient's leg, arm or chest to use as \"new\" vessels for bypass grafts. \nThere are three techniques for harvesting a vessel for a CABG procedure: open, bridging and EVH. EVH uses special instruments to view and remove a blood vessel with much less trauma to the vessel itself or to surrounding tissues than bridging or an \"open\" procedure.  In the past, one long incision was made from the ankle to the groin; this procedure is called an open procedure.  It is highly invasive, often caused patients more pain than their chest incision, and resulted in a long scar.  An alternative, less invasive technique to the open procedure is called \"bridging\". Bridging enables harvesters to gain access to the saphenous vein through three or four smaller incisions of about three inches.  EVH is minimally invasive and uses special instruments to view and remove the blood vessel. EVH usually only requires one small incision about one inch long. The EVH procedure is performed immediately before heart surgery and can be used for the following vessels:  The greater saphenous vein, which runs the length of the leg; the radial artery, which runs from the wrist to the elbow in the arm.  There is generally little patient discomfort from endoscopic vessel harvesting, especially when compared to open or bridging procedures. In clinical studies, some important benefits have been shown in EVH including:\n\no\tSignificantly less risk of infection and wound complications \no\tLess postoperative pain and swelling \no\tFaster recovery with minimal scarring \no\tGreater patient satisfaction\n\nThe VASOVIEW 6 PRO System is indicated for use in minimally invasive surgery allowing access for vessel harvesting, and is primarily indicated for patients undergoing endoscopic surgery for arterial bypass. It is indicated for cutting tissue and controlling bleeding through coagulation, and for patients requiring blunt dissection of tissue including dissection of blood vessels, dissection of blood vessels of the extremities, dissection of ducts and other structures in the extraperitoneal or subcutaneous extremity and thoracic space. Extremity procedures include tissue dissection/vessel harvesting along the saphenous vein for use in coronary artery bypass grafting and peripheral artery bypass or the radial artery for use in coronary artery bypass grafting. Thorascopic procedures include exposure and dissection of structures external to the parietal pleura, including nerves, blood vessels and other tissues of the chest wall.\n\nDevice Description:\nThe VASOVIEW 6 PRO Cannula\nThe VASOVIEW 6 PRO Harvesting Cannula (Figure 1) is designed for use in conjunction with the 7 mm Endoscope. The Harvesting Cannula has four lumens which house the Endoscope, C-Ring, distal lens washer tube and Bipolar Bisector for ligation and division of vessel branches. The C-Ring/distal lens washer is independently controlled by a C-Ring Slider on the handle of the device for retraction of the vessel as well as washing of the distal tip of the endoscope. The Bipolar Bisector can be extended/retracted/rotated with the Bisector Carriage. Mechanical cutting is achieved with the Bisector Toggle located on the Bisector Carriage. Bipolar coagulation is achieved using electrosurgical energy. Positioning of the device, coagulation, and mechanical cutting are performed under endoscopic visualization. This device is intended for use with the bipolar outputs of compatible generators.\n\nItem Specifications:\nStock No. VH-2400, Item No. 119706 - VASOVIEW 6 PRO - This product is sterile unless the package is opened or damaged.

Please review the official application notice for pre-application and application requirements, application submission information, performance measures, priorities and program contact information.\n\nPurpose of Program: The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) Grant Program aims to increase student achievement by improving the quality of new prospective teachers by enhancing the preparation of prospective teachers and the professional development activities for current teachers; holding teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education (IHEs) accountable for preparing highly qualified teachers; and recruiting effective individuals, including minorities and individuals from other occupations, into the teaching force.\n    Background: The TQP Grant Program supports partnerships among (i) IHEs, (ii) high-need local educational agencies (LEAs), and (iii) high-need schools served by such LEAs or high-need early childhood education (ECE) programs. These partnerships must implement (a) teacher preparation programs at the pre-baccalaureate or ``fifth-year&apos;&apos; level that include specific reforms in IHEs&apos; existing teacher preparation programs; (b) teacher residency programs for individuals with strong academic or professional backgrounds but without teaching experience; or (c) both.\n    In this competition, we are especially interested in supporting partnership programs that prepare teachers to teach subjects in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In his 2011 State of the Union address, the President called for a new effort to prepare 100,000 STEM teachers over the next decade with strong teaching skills and deep content knowledge. The President&apos;s goal has been incorporated into an Administration-wide priority, as part of the both the Federal STEM Education 5-Year Strategic Plan \\1\\ released in May 2013 and as a Cross Agency Priority Goal \\2\\ announced earlier this year. In addition, answering the President&apos;s call to action, nearly 200 organizations have formed a coalition called 100Kin10, all committed to the goal of increasing the supply of excellent STEM teachers; hiring, developing, and retaining excellent STEM teachers; and building the 100Kin10 movement.\n\nCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number: 84.336S.\n\nApplications for grants under the TQP Grant Program, CFDA number 84.336S, must be submitted electronically using the Government wide Grants.gov Apply site at www.Grants.gov.

Each of the initiatives has identified primary sites for focused investigations, as well as thematic studies that will complement primary site studiesFurther information and a science plan for the program detailing each initiative and the associated thematic studies, as well as the overarching themes, can be found on the GeoPRISMS website at http://www.geoprisms.org/.  The expected level of funding will be approximately $5 million per year for the foreseeable future.", "agency": "National Science Foundation", "listing_url": "http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=253686", "posted_dt": "2014-04-10T00:00:00Z", "solnbr": "14-556", "title": "GeoPRISMS Program", "data_source": "grants.gov"}, "_type": "opp", "_index": "fbopen0"}

Program Overview\nThe Community Assistance Program ? State Support Services Element (CAP-SSSE) program provides funding to States to provide technical assistance to communities in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) \n\nand to evaluate community performance in implementing NFIP floodplain management activities.\nb. Program Priorities\nIn Fiscal Year 2014, the CAP-SSSE program will focus on compliance and enforcement. While map adoption, disaster activities, training and other assistance activities remain important components of the \n\nprogram?s overall community assistance strategy, a credible compliance and enforcement program is essential to meet the program?s goals of flood loss reduction.\nCAP-SSSE Eligible Activities and Requirements\nFEMA Regional Offices are to determine the appropriate levels of effort in each activity to ensure that performance metrics are being met. FEMA is requiring certain measures, and encouraging others, for some \n\nof the CAP-SSSE activities as described below.\n1. Community Assistance Visits (CAV) and Community Assistance Contacts (CAC): States participating in CAP-SSSE are required to conduct CAVs and CACs. States will be required to incorporate the risk-based \n\nprioritization as described in the National Flood Insurance Program Guidance for Conducting Community Assistance Contacts and Community Assistance Visits. The Regions will work with each State to determine \n\nthe number of CAVs and CACs to be conducted and to ensure that selection is based on the risk-based approach described above. Regions and States are encouraged to make maximum use of the CAC process and \n\nother contacts with communities to identify potential compliance problems and needs for technical assistance. The document also provides guidance in planning for, conducting and providing follow-up for these \n\nactivities. States must provide appropriate follow-up to CAVs and CACs by providing technical assistance to correct program deficiencies and remedy violations to the maximum extent possible. States must \n\ncoordinate with Regions, as necessary, to clarify what follow-up is to be provided. States are expected to refer community compliance problems that they are unable to resolve to the Regional Office. \n\nHeadquarters staff will also be available for training at Regional CAP Conferences. All CAVs and CACs must be entered into CIS so that FEMA can monitor this important floodplain management activity.\n\n2. Ordinance Assistance: Assisting communities in reviewing local ordinances to ensure compliance with NFIP requirements and adoption before Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) become effective is of paramount \n\nimportance. This includes necessary ordinance revisions based upon new hazard data provided by FEMA, as well as incorporating any regulatory changes to meet minimum floodplain management criteria. State \n\nCooperative Agreements shall include a performance measure relating to map adoption. The metric will measure the percentage of participating communities that have an adopted ordinance referencing the updated \n\nmap by the FIRM effective date. States must include a mandatory map adoption rate of 93% or higher into their cooperative agreement.\n3. Strategic Planning: Strategic Planning is an optional task and provides an opportunity to assess the current status of a State program and plan for future year demands, find efficiencies, and explore \n\nopportunities for expanded services. In cooperation with FEMA, the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) has developed a guidance document for strategic planning within State floodplain management \n\nprograms. The guidance document can be found at http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/floodplain/fema_cap-ssse.shtm and www.floods.org.\n4. CAP Gap Analysis: States may optionally choose to conduct an annual gap analysis by using the CAP GAP tool provided at http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/floodplain/fema_cap-ssse.shtm. The data collected in \n\nthe annual analyses has been used to create budget justifications for the current funding. States who believe they may benefit from providing a more refined or revised GAP analysis may optionally submit this \n\nto the Region for future year consideration. The GAP analysis is also an important part of the strategic planning process and can be utilized by States in their planning efforts.\n5. State Model Ordinance Updates and Monitoring of State Regulatory Environment: Most States have developed a State model floodplain management ordinance containing the minimum requirements outlined in 44 \n\nCFR Section 60.3, as well as any State required floodplain management provisions. In addition, States are encouraged to offer their communities model ordinances that include higher regulatory standards and \n\nassist communities to update their model ordinances to include higher standards. States are also encouraged to monitor legal issues affecting floodplain management regulations and activities related to State \n\nbuilding code adoption and modifications.\na. Model Building Codes: Many States adopt a building code that is based on one or more of the model codes developed by the International Code Council (the I-Codes) or the National Fire Protection \n\nAssociation. Most States require all or some communities to enforce the code. Unless modified by a State, the model codes contain NFIP-consistent provisions for buildings and structures. FEMA and States must \n\nensure an understanding of the implications that the enforcement of these codes have on the local regulatory environment in order to provide accurate technical assistance. States should review their model \n\nordinances and work with communities to ensure that they understand the implications of these codes and how they are enforced with respect to NFIP requirements. A model companion ordinance designed \n\nspecifically to coordinate with building codes based on the I-Codes will be provided to the Regional Offices. State NFIP coordinators should coordinate with their counterparts in the State code commission or \n\nState agency that is responsible for the building code, especially with respect to interpretations that the code commission or State agency may be asked to issue. The Building Science Branch at FEMA \n\nHeadquarters is available upon request to provide training on the flood provisions of the International Codes at Regional CAP Conferences.\n\n6. Outreach, Workshops, and Other Training: States are encouraged to conduct outreach, workshops, and other training for local officials and other stakeholders, including insurance agents, lenders, \n\nadjustors, realtors, land surveyors, and design professionals to support implementation and enforcement of community floodplain management regulations, promotion of hazard identification, providing NFIP \n\ninsurance training, and support of local and State planning initiatives. States should conduct workshops and other training and outreach opportunities on a schedule and at locations that are coordinated with \n\nthe FEMA Region.\nOther Training\na. ASFPM Activities and Credentialing: FEMA encourages State floodplain management personnel to attain Certified Floodplain Manager (CFM) credentials. State employees that are involved in floodplain \n\nmanagement activities may use CAP-SSSE funds for costs associated with the initial exam and biennial CFM renewal fees. States are further encouraged to sponsor and proctor CFM exams in coordination with the \n\nASFPM. Note: CAP- SSSE funding cannot be used to reimburse Individual ASFPM membership fees.\nAt the discretion of the Region, States may use limited CAP-SSSE funding to allow local officials to attend and/or assist with the annual ASFPM conference held within their State. These costs must be \n\nnegotiated with the Region as part of the annual agreement.\nb. CAP-SSSE funds may be used to reimburse travel costs associated with attendance by State floodplain management personnel at the ASFPM National Conference, FEMA Regional Office CAP-SSSE Coordination \n\nMeetings, and in-State Silver Jackets coordination meetings. Other national and regional meetings related to floodplain management may be considered for reimbursement if approved in advance by Regional \n\nOffice CAP-SSSE staff.\n\n7. General Technical Assistance: States should provide general technical assistance to communities and individuals to resolve floodplain management issues related to the NFIP.\n\n8. Enrollment of Communities: States should assist communities in joining the NFIP by providing technical assistance to ensure the community meets the minimum eligibility requirements for participation.\n9. Community Rating System (CRS) Support: States should assist communities in joining the NFIP Community Rating System (CRS) through providing general technical assistance, conducting entry CAVs and \n\nproviding support for activities credited by CRS.\n10. Mapping Coordination Assistance: As part of the Flood Map Modernization process and the FEMA Risk Map Initiative, States must work with the Regions to develop flood mapping priorities and participate in \n\ncommunity meetings held as part of the mapping process. In addition to CAP-SSSE grants, States are eligible for Cooperating Technical Partner (CTP) Program Management funding to meet these responsibilities. \n\nThe CAP- SSSE plans must be developed separately from, but in coordination with, the CTP Program Management plans to ensure that CTP is used to complement CAP-SSSE activities and that States will meet all of \n\ntheir responsibilities under Flood Map Modernization and Risk Map. Neither CTP Program Management nor CAP-SSSE funds can be used for conducting floodplain studies or developing floodplain maps. However, \n\nseveral activities are allowable under both grant programs, including map adoption, training, and outreach. Use of these resources should be closely coordinated to prevent duplication of effort.\n11. Coordination with Other State Programs and Agencies: States are encouraged to coordinate with other State administered programs that impact floodplain management such as the Hazard Mitigation Assistance \n\n(HMA) that includes: Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, and Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. Additional coordination may include the State Dam Safety Program, State land-\n\nuse, building code and water resources programs, as well as State agencies that routinely conduct activities within floodplains, such as State Departments of Transportation or port authorities. Coordination \n\nwith other State agencies on adoption and implementation of State Executive Orders and regulations that meet State NFIP requirements is also encouraged.\n12. Assistance to Communities in Responding to Disasters: States are encouraged to provide post-disaster assistance and support to NFIP communities. Examples of these activities include: technical assistance \n\nimplementing substantial damage requirements, including use of the Substantial Damage Estimating Software; assistance to communities enrolling into the NFIP; general floodplain management technical \n\nassistance; assistance with the promotion and use of the NFIP Increased Cost of Compliance coverage; and assistance with HMA programs. Generally, these activities are not included in the annual CAP-SSSE \n\nAgreement, but can be negotiated when a disaster occurs. The CAP-SSSE Agreement must be modified to reflect these changes when they occur.\n\nSelection of CACs and CAVs\nA risk based approach is intended to help ensure that limited staff resources are applied to the communities most in need of a CAV or CAC in each fiscal year in a cost-effective manner. The selection of CACs \n\nand CAVs to be conducted shall continue to use the CAV Tier 1 Prioritization Tool as guidance for determining which communities should receive a CAV. While Selection of CAVs using the Tier 1 tool is \n\nrequired, States and regions may, by exception, select Tier 2 communities for CAVs, with justification added to the CAV Comment Field in the Community Information System (CIS).\nSpecial Attention to Mechanical, Electrical, and Utility Equipment and Flood Openings The NFIP Evaluation also concluded that the most common type of violation found in the Study?s quantitative assessment of \n\nbuilding compliance were mechanical and utility equipment located below the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and openings that do not meet requirements at 44 CFR 60.3(c)(5). Between them, these two types of \n\nviolations accounted for 50 percent of the violations found within the sample. To improve enforcement of these requirements, special consideration and attention should be paid to mechanical, utility and \n\nopenings requirements during CAVs.\nState CAVs\nIn coordination with the State NFIP Coordinator, Regional Offices may determine that a CAV of the State floodplain management program is appropriate. Regional staff may request assistance with coordination \n\nwith State agencies or officials, the collection of data and other assistance in preparation of conducting the CAV.\nc.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern. ?Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database? means that? (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database; (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and (4) The Government has marked the record ?Active?. ?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes? (1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government; (2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and (3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.  (b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to? (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement  -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions.

PECASE: Each year NSF selects nominees for the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) from among the most meritorious recent CAREER awardees. Selection for this award is based on two important criteria:?? 1) innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology that is relevant to the mission of the sponsoring organization or agency, and 2) community service demonstrated through scientific leadership, education or community outreach. These awards foster innovative developments in science and technology, increase awareness of careers in science and engineering, give recognition to the scientific missions of the participating agencies, enhance connections between fundamental research and national goals, and highlight the importance of science and technology for the Nation??s future. Individuals cannot apply for PECASE. These awards are initiated by the participating federal agencies. At NSF, up to twenty nominees for this award are selected each year from among the PECASE-eligible CAREER awardees who are most likely to become the leaders of academic research and education in the twenty-first century.

Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MS-1209-54_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems are eligible for participation. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.\r\nThese Chest Tube Drainage Systems products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.\r\nThis Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MS-1209-54_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month \"option\" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is July 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL MS-1209-54_ Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Chest Tube Drainage Systems.\r\nA. Products & Performance Required. The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Chest Tube Drainage Systems. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $411,934.00 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.\r\nB. Instructions to VendorsVendors on the QSL MS-1209-54_Chest_Tube_Drainage_Systems who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.

Source Selection Procedures Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.\r\nVendor Instructions for Pricing SubmissionChest Tube Drainage Systems pricing requirements are outlined below.
