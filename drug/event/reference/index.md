## About adverse events

    https://api.fda.gov/drug/event

The openFDA drug adverse event API returns data from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/faers/">FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)</a>, a database that contains information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to FDA. Currently, this data covers publically releasable records submitted to the FDA from 2004-2013. The data is updated quarterly.

An adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. For drugs, this includes serious drug side effects, product use errors, product quality problems, and therapeutic failures for prescription or over-the-counter medicines and medicines administered to hospital patients or at outpatient infusion centers.

{% include panel.html type="warning" title="Important note about FAERS data" text="FAERS data does have limitations. There is no certainty that the reported event (adverse event or medication error) was actually due to the product. FDA does not require that a causal relationship between a product and event be proven, and reports do not always contain enough detail to properly evaluate an event.<br /><br />Further, FDA does not receive reports for every adverse event or medication error that occurs with a product. Many factors can influence whether or not an event will be reported, such as the time a product has been marketed and publicity about an event. Therefore, FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. population.<br /><br />In 2012, FDA changed from the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). There was a minor shift in terms as part of this transition. If you are using data from before December 2012, you should be aware of this shift." %}

### Format

Adverse event reports use the [ICH E2b/M2 version 2.1 standard.](http://estri.ich.org/e2br22/ICH_ICSR_Specification_V2-3.pdf) OpenFDA annotates the original records with [special fields.](#openfda-fields)

### Data downloads

FDA releases [quarterly updates to FAERS data.](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm) OpenFDA uses these extracts, but processes the data further before supplying them through the API. During our beta, we are investigating the best ways to offer direct downloads of data provided by the API. 

### Who reports adverse events?

Reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and consumers is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event reports directly from healthcare professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report adverse events to the productsâ€™ manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is normally required to send the report to FDA.

### Responsible use of the data

Adverse event reports submitted to FDA do not undergo extensive validation or verification. Therefore, **a causal relationship cannot be established between product and reactions listed in a report.** While a suspected relationship *may* exist, it is not medically validated and should not be the sole source of information for clinical decision making or other assumptions about the safety or efficacy of a product.

Additionally, it is important to remember that adverse event reports represent a small percentage of total usage numbers of a product. Common products may have a higher number of adverse events due to the higher total number of people using the product. In recent years the FDA has undertaken efforts to increase collection of adverse events. Increases in the total number of adverse events is likely caused by improved reporting.

### How adverse events are organized

Adverse events are collected through a series of *safety reports.* Each is identified by a 8-digit string (for instance, `6176304-1`). The first 7 digits (before the hyphen) identify the individual report, and the last digit (after the hyphen) is a checksum. Rather than updating individual records in FAERS, subsequent updates are submitted in seperate reports.

## Anatomy of a response

Here's an example API return from OpenFDA. This particular response features one result. The return is split into two high-level sections: `meta` and `results`. Note that this record is not real.

##### openFDA fields

Different datasets use different drug identifiersâ€”brand name, generic name, NDA, NDC, etc. It can be difficult to find the same drug in different datasets. And some identifiers, like pharmacologic class, are useful search filters but not available in all datasets.

OpenFDA features harmonization of drug identifiers, to make it easier to connect adverse event report records to other drug information. Drug products that appear in FAERS records are joined to the NDC dataset first on brand name, and if there is no brand name, on generic name. If that is succesful, further links are established to other datasets. **The linked data is listed as an `openfda` annotation in the `patient.drug` section of a result.**

Roughly 86% of adverse event records have at least one `openfda` section. Because the harmonization process requires an exact match, some drug products cannot be harmonized in this fashionâ€”for instance, if the drug name is misspelled. Some drug products will have `openfda` sections, while others will never, if there was no match during the harmonization process.

{% include panel.html type="warning" title="Important note about <strong>openfda</strong> fields" text="A single drug product listed in an adverse event report may have multiple associated manufacturer names, NDCs, and SPLs in a corresponding <strong>openfda</strong> section. That is because the drug may have multiple manufacturers, packagers, dosage forms, etc. Their inclusion in the <strong>openfda</strong> section does not mean that they had any connection to the adverse event. The ordering of data in <strong>openfda</strong> fields is not significant." %}

##### Patient reaction data

`patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt`
: [MedDRA](http://www.meddra.org/) term(s) for the reaction(s). Note that these terms are encoded in British English. For instance, "diarrhea" is recorded as "diarrohea."

`patient.reaction.reactionmeddraversionpt`
: The [MedDRA](http://www.meddra.org/) version that `patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt` uses.

`patient.reaction.reactionoutcome`
: Outcome of the reaction/event at the time of last observation
: `1` = recovered/resolved
: `2` = recovering/resolving
: `3` = not recovered/not resolved
: `4` = recovered/resolved with sequelae
: `5` = fatal
: `6` = unknown
