## Using Dust Templates

The dust templates should be pre-compiled, so if you edit them, first you'll need to install dustc

```
npm install -g dustjs-linkedin
```

and then you'll need to run a command from this directory like so:

```
dustc -n=result dust-src/result.dust dust-compiled/result.js
```

If you don't include the `-n` flag and template name, you'll get errors about Dust not being able to find the template.
