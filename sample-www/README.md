# FBOpen Sample Query App

### Install
* Copy these files and folders to any web server. (They're all static assets; no special server config is necessary.)
* In `config/fbopen_config.js`, modify `API_SERVER` as necessary to point at your API server.
* Point your browser at `index.html`.

### To do
* add more query filter options
* support arbitrary rather than hard-coded data sources (by querying for available data sources; requires concomitant API change)
* sorting
* restore (and clean up) tagging code
* authentication
* saved queries and/or saved results (aka "portfolios")
* your great ideas
