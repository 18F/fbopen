* Learn more about the [data in FBOpen]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-sources). _We're currently indexing data from FedBizOpps (including attachments) and Grants.gov._

### About the FBOpen API

FBOpen is a thin, RESTful search API, hosted by the awesome [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov), and backed by the [search index server, Solr](hnttp://lucene.apache.org/solr/), soon to be updated to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elasticsearch.org). Visit our API documentation at [18f.github.io/fbopen](https://18f.github.io/fbopen/).

We have used this approach, which we named Beckley, as a model for [other projects](http://18fblog.tumblr.com/post/85232393363/a-few-notes-on-notalone-gov). Beckley, which is implemented in nodeJS and ExpressJS, is [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/18f/beckley).
