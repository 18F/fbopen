The 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW) is requesting information and conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources which have the capability to provide security services at the 505 CCW and its subordinate units. This announcement closes 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, 6 Jan 2014. The Government is seeking industry input from all sources (small and large businesses) at this time. Small Business concerns are highly encouraged to respond to this request in order for the Government to determine if this acquisition should be a total small business set aside under the auspices of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 561621 (Alarm System Monitoring Services) with a corresponding size standard of $19M. Interested parties must be registered under NAICS 561621 in SAM (System for Award Management) at www.sam.gov, formerly known as CCR (Central Contractor Registration).

(b) Although &quot;proposal&quot; and &quot;offeror&quot; are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is for planning and market research purposes only and should not be considered as a request for proposals or as a solicitation to do business with the Government.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Air Combat Command, Acquisition Management Integration Center (ACC AMIC) PKBC-OL (505 CCW/PK), Hurlburt Field, FL, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy to obtain non-personal services to support Wing and subordinate units to ensure the protection and safeguarding of Collateral, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Special Technical Operations (STO) and Special Access Programs (SAP) activities in the following core security mission areas: Security Management, Personnel Security, Information Security, Physical Security, Information Systems Security/Information Assurance (IA), Communications Security (COMSEC), Security Awareness, Training and Education (SATE), Operation Security (OPSEC), Industrial Security, Foreign Disclosure, SAP Systems Administration, and security courseware development and academic instruction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Performance will consist of a Phase-In/Transition period (length of Phase-In period is TBD), one (1) base period, and four (4) one-year option periods.
