        <FundingOppDescription>The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), operating through the Risk Management Agency (RMA), announces the availability of approximately $500,000 (subject to availability of funds) for Commodity Partnerships for Small Agricultural Risk Management Education Sessions (Commodity Partnerships Small Sessions Program). The purpose of this cooperative partnership agreement program is to deliver training and information in the management of production, marketing, and financial risk to U.S. agricultural producers in small sessions. The program is to give priority to educating producers of crops not insurable with Federal crop insurance, specialty crops, and underserved commodities, including livestock and forage. A maximum of 50 cooperative partnership agreements will be funded, five each in ten designated RMA Regions. The maximum award for any agreement will be $10,000. Recipients of awards must demonstrate nonfinancial benefits from a partnership agreement and must agree to the substantial involvement of RMA in the project. Funding availability for this program may be announced at approximately the same time as funding availability for similar but separate programs. CFDA No. 10.455 (Community Outreach and Assistance Partnerships), CFDA No. 10.456 (Risk Management Research Partnerships),  CFDA No. 10.457 (Commodity Partnerships for Risk Management Education) and CFDA No.10.458 (Crop Insurance Education in Targeted States). Prospective applicants should carefully examine and compare the notices for each program.</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>Grants for Fellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions (FPIRI) support fellowships at institutions devoted to advanced study and research in the humanities. NEH fellowships provide scholars with research time and access to resources that might not be available at their home institutions. Fellowship programs may be administered by independent centers for advanced study, libraries, and museums in the United States; American overseas research centers; or organizations that have expertise in promoting research on foreign cultures. Individual scholars must apply directly to the institutions themselves. A list of currently funded institutions is available. In evaluating applications from programs at institutions located in the United States, priority is given to those with library holdings, archives, or other special collectionseither on-site or nearbythat are available as resources for NEH fellows. American overseas research centers should demonstrate a particular benefit to NEH fellows by virtue of their location and other resources. FPIRI gramts provide funding to programs for humanities fellowships of four to twelve months. Fellowship tenure must be continuous.   FPIRI grants support fellowship stipends and standard allowances, as well as a portion of the costs for both publicizing the availability of the fellowships and selecting the fellows. The stipends and allowances for NEH fellows are determined in accordance with an institution's usual practices. However, the maximum amount of NEH funding is $50,400 for a six- to twelve-month fellowship and $25,200 for a four- to five-month fellowship. A grantee institution may supplement the stipends of NEH fellows from its own funds, and fellows may receive additional funds from other sources. NEH fellows must be granted the same benefits, services, and accommodations normally accorded other fellows.</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>NNH08ZDA001N, entitled "Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences - 2008 (ROSES-2008)," will be available on or about February 15, 2008, by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/  and then linking through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations."  This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) solicits proposals for supporting basic and applied research and technology across a broad range of Earth and space science program elements relevant to one or more of the following NASA Research Programs: Earth Science, Heliophysics, Planetary Science, and Astrophysics.  This ROSES NRA covers all aspects of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, including, but not limited to: theory, modeling, and analysis of SMD science data; aircraft, stratospheric balloon, and suborbital rocket investigations; development of experiment techniques suitable for future SMD space missions; development of concepts for future SMD space missions; development of advanced technologies relevant to SMD missions; development of techniques for and the laboratory analysis of both extraterrestrial samples returned by spacecraft, as well as terrestrial samples that support or otherwise help verify observations from SMD Earth system science missions; determination of atomic and composition parameters needed to analyze space data, as well as returned samples from the Earth or space; Earth surface observations and field campaigns that support SMD science missions; development of integrated Earth system models; development of systems for applying Earth science research data to societal needs; and development of applied information systems applicable to SMD objectives and data.  Awards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The funds available for awards in each program element offered in this NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which allow selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers depending on the nature of the proposing organization and/or program requirements. The typical period of performance for an award is four years, although a few programs may specify shorter or longer periods. Participation is open to all categories of organizations, foreign and domestic, including educational institutions, industry, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other Government agencies, without restriction on number or teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. Proposal due dates are scheduled starting on May 9, 2008, and continue through March 27, 2009.  Electronically submitted Notices of Intent to propose are requested for most program elements, with the first such due date being March 14, 2008.  Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization.  Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov.  Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must also be registered with Grants.gov.  Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal.  All principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators) must be registered in NSPIRES.  Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information.    Individual program elements under this solicitation may be found by using the Advanced Search method in Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov/search/advanced.do). In the "Search by Funding Opportunity Number" box, enter the ROSES solicitation number of NNH08ZDA001N followed by an * (i.e., NNH08ZDA001N*). This will result in a list of all posted program elements. Use the funding number associated with the program element you wish to apply for to download the application package. Further information about specific program elements may be obtained from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element in this NRA, while questions concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Dr. Yvonne Pendleton, Senior Advisor for Research and Analysis, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001; E-mail: sara@nasa.gov; Telephone: 202-358-1182.</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>As part of the NEH's We the People program, Interpreting Americas Historic Places grants support public humanities projects that exploit the evocative power of historic places to address themes and issues central to American history and culture, including those that advance knowledge of how the founding principles of the United States have shaped American history and culture for more than two hundred years. Interpreting Americas Historic Places planning grants support planning that leads to the interpretation of a single historic site or house, a series of sites, an entire neighborhood, a town or community, or a larger geographical region. The place taken as a whole must be significant to American history, and the project must convey its historic importance to visitors. The audience for Interpreting Americas Historic Places projects is the general public. (For other public humanities projects that may not focus so closely on historic places, refer to the planning grant guidelines for Americas Historical and Cultural Organizations.) The goals of Interpreting Americas Historic Places grants are to  enhance lifelong learning in American history by connecting nationally significant events, people, ideas, stories, and traditions with specific places;   foster the development of interpretive programs for the public that address central events, themes, and issues in American history; and   encourage consultation with humanities scholars and history organizations in the development of heritage tourism destinations.   Interpreting Americas Historic Places projects should  interpret a place that played a significant role in American history;   enrich the visitor experience at one or more historic places by interpreting these places in light of broader themes in American history;   make use of the specific features of one or more historic placesthe site, its location, buildings, or other natural or built featuresas integral parts of the proposed interpretation;   be based on sound humanities scholarship;   involve humanities scholars in all phases of development and implementation;   approach the subject thematically, analytically, and interpretively through an appropriate variety of perspectives;   interest broad audiences; and   employ appealing and accessible program formats that will actively engage the public in learning.</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>The Office of Citizen Exchanges of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for grants that support exchanges and build relationships between U.S. non-profit organizations and civil society and cultural groups in Africa, East Asia, Europe, the Near East, North Africa, South Central Asia and the Western Hemisphere. Pending availability of funds, it is anticipated that approximately $5,000,000 or more will be available to support this competition. ECA/PE/C expects to fund approximately 15-20 projects under this competition in FY 2008. U.S. public and non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in Internal Revenue code section 26 USC 501(c)(3) may submit proposals that support the goals of The Professional Exchange Program. Projects should promote mutual understanding and partnerships between key professional and cultural groups in the United States and counterpart groups in other countries through multi-phased exchanges taking place over one to two years. Proposals should encourage citizen engagement in current issues, with a particular focus on youth and those who influence them, and promote the development of democratic societies and institutions, with a view toward creating a more stable world. To the fullest extent possible, programs should be two-way exchanges supporting roughly equal numbers of participants from the U.S. and foreign countries.       Proposed projects should transform institutional and individual understanding of key issues, foster dialogue, share expertise, and develop capacity. Through these people-to-people exchanges, the Bureau seeks to break down stereotypes that divide peoples, to promote good governance and economic growth, to contribute to conflict prevention and management, and to build respect for cultural expression and identity in the world. Projects should be structured to allow American professionals and their international counterparts in eligible countries to develop a common dialogue for dealing with shared challenges and concerns. Projects should include current or potential leaders who will effect positive change in their communities. Exchange participants may include community leaders, elected and professional government officials, religious leaders, educators, and proponents of democratic ideals and institutions, including for example, the media and judiciary, or others who influence the way in which different communities approach these issues. The Bureau is especially interested in engaging socially and economically diverse groups that may not have had extensive contact with counterpart institutions in the United States and particularly seeks proposals that engage educators or other groups that directly influence youth in innovative ways.   </FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>The U. S. Department of Justices Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) are collaborating to enhance the capacity of juvenile courts and juvenile drug courts to improve and increase the availability of Brief Interventions and Referrals to Treatment (BIRT) and to establish partnerships between juvenile courts and juvenile drug courts to ensure that substance abusing juvenile offenders receive effective and appropriate treatment. Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 5 sessions (MET/CBT) for adolescents is the protocol that applicants will be required to implement under BIRT.     In an era when cost containments are important acknowledgements, collaborative efforts which improve the expansion of treatment availability to the juvenile court and the juvenile drug court systems are critical. BIRT provides a resource to juvenile court and juvenile drug court systems by providing access to a relatively short, non- intensive brief intervention therapeutic model which assists in identifying the most appropriate referrals and admissions criteria for youth involved in the juvenile justice system. Following a screening to be conducted by the juvenile courts that will identify all adolescents involved in the juvenile court system who use substances of abuse the objective of this resource is to provide a brief intervention protocol (MET/CBT) to those youth for whom this intervention is an appropriate response to their severity of substance use. Those adolescents who are identified to need more intensive treatment will be referred to appropriate adolescent treatment and juvenile drug court. The primary objective of identifying substance abusing youth is long term reductions in substance abuse-related morbidity and associated problems. A secondary objective of this effort will be significant savings regarding health care and juvenile court costs.     This solicitation invites juvenile courts in collaboration with juvenile drug courts to implement BIRT and to define and identify the benefits of partnerships between juvenile courts and juvenile drug courts to ensure that substance abusing juvenile offenders receive effective and appropriate treatment. </FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>The purpose of this amendment is to request full applications to the Funding Opportunity Announcement(FOA) DE-FOA-0000290 with a deadline for submission of Monday, May 24, 2010 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Earlier submissions are encouraged.  The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) is a new agency of the department of Energy. ARPA-E was authorized by the America COMPETES Act (PL 110-69) and charged with the mission to fund projects that will develop transformational technologies that reduce Americas dependence on foreign energy imports; reduce U.S. energy related emissions, including greenhouse gases; improve energy efficiency across all sectors of the U.S. economy; and ensure that the United States maintains its leadership in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies. Initially funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (PL 111-5), ARPA-E aims to support the development of high risk/high payoff applied science and technology innovations that will have a positive disruptive impact on the energy landscape.   In this program, ARPA-E seeks to develop a new generation of low-cost energy storage technologies for the electricity grid.  A key role of energy storage is to transform the grid from a system for delivering electric power where it is needed, to system that flexibility adapts to changes in where electric power is needed.  The added dimension of time enables a radical increase in the use of electricity from intermittent renewable resources, such as wind and solar.  The goals of this program are targeted to develop innovative energy storage technologies which have the cost and reliability of hydroelectric power, yet have the capacity for deployment in any location.  The cost effective grid-scale energy storage technologies developed in this program will lower CO2 emissions from U.S. electricity generation, improve security through enhanced power reliability and establish U.S. leadership in advanced energy storage systems.  ARPA-E's objective is to fund high-risk, high-reward re  search efforts to address emerging grid-scale energy storage needs.  For attachments and forms and/or instructions you may also see the ARPA-E website at https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov  All questions to this FOA must be submitted via e-mail to  ARPA-E-CO@hq.doe.gov.  All full applications must be submitted via the ARPA-E exchange at https://arpa-e-foa-energy.gov/ </FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>&amp;quot;Note: For proposals with significant emphasis on sustainable chemistry, consider making proposal submissions to this program with the Proposal Title as: &amp;lsquo;SusChEM: Name of Your Proposal'. For more information, see the DCL on SusChEM (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13013/nsf13013.pdf"&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13013/nsf13013.pdf&lt;/a&gt;), a new NSF Emphasis Area.&amp;quot;  The Chemical Catalysis Program supports experimental and theoretical research directed towards the fundamental understanding of the chemistry of catalytic processes at the molecular level. The Program accepts proposals on catalytic approaches,&lt;a name="_GoBack" title="_GoBack"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which facilitate, direct, and accelerate efficient chemical transformations. This includes the design and synthesis of catalytic species on the molecular, supramolecular, and nanometer scales as well as studies of the dynamics of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. Processes of interest include (but are not limited to): polymerization catalysis, single site catalysis, and biologically-inspired catalysis. Applications of modeling, theory, and simulation to catalytic processes are also relevant. Fundamental studies of energy-related catalytic processes, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, electrocatalysis (such as in water splitting and fuel cells), and photocatalysis (such as in solar energy conversion) are welcome in the program.  Submissions that address national needs for sustainability are particularly encouraged. Examples of sustainable chemistry appropriate for the Chemical Catalysis Program include: 1) the design, preparation and reactivity studies associated with new catalysts and catalytic processes that will replace rare, expensive and/or toxic compounds or nanomaterials with earth abundant, inexpensive and benign alternatives; 2) new chemistries to economically recycle chemicals that cannot be replaced, such as phosphorus and the rare earth elements; 3) new chemistries to convert non-petroleum based sources of organics to feedstock chemicals; and 4) new environmentally-friendly chemical reactions and processes that require less energy, fresh water, and/or organic solvents than current practice.  Investigators are urged to read more about NSF efforts in encouraging sustainable synthesis, and the use and reuse of chemicals and materials in the Dear Colleague Letter on SusChEM: &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12097/nsf12097.jsp?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&amp;amp;WT.mc_ev=click"&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12097/nsf12097.jsp?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&amp;amp;WT.mc_ev=click&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;  The Program does not support applied catalysis research that focuses on scale-up, processing, transport dynamics, long-term stability and other engineering aspects of catalysis. The Program also does not support biocatalysis research with purely biological enzymes and cellular systems. Catalytic research whose immediate objectives are the synthesis of complex natural products using established catalysts should be submitted to the Chemical Synthesis program.</FundingOppDescription>

The PAC program is open to co-review of proposals submitted to other programs (e.g., Linguistics, Developmental and Learning Sciences, Cognitive Neuroscience, etc). Proposals may involve clinical populations, animals, or computational modeling only if the work has direct impact on basic issues of human perception, action, or cognition.  Within one week of receipt of the proposal number from FastLane, each PI must send the following two documents via email to &lt;a href="mailto:sbe-pac@nsf.gov"&gt;sbe-pac@nsf.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The subject heading of the email should note the proposal number and the Principal Investigator. Attach the following documents prepared on the following templates.  &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An Excel spreadsheet with two worksheet pages that will be used by NSF to check for conflicts of interest in assembling the review community.(&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/pac/Excel_Template_for_PAC.xlsx" target="_blank"&gt;Excel Template for PAC&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single PowerPoint slide with (a) name and affiliation of all senior personnel, (b) title of your proposal, and (c) a very brief (1-3 sentences at most) summary of the main hypotheses and methods. The slide may only include graphs, images, or other illustrations if they appear in the proposal. You must use the template (&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/bcs/pac/PPT_Template_for_PAC.pptx" target="_blank"&gt;PowerPoint Templatefor PAC&lt;/a&gt;) and name the file with the PI'slast namefollowed by the seven digitproposal number(e.g., Smith 127999). This will be used during review panel discussions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; Remember to email these two documents to: &lt;a href="mailto:sbe-pac@nsf.gov"&gt;sbe-pac@nsf.gov&lt;/a&gt;; do not use FastLane.

        <FundingOppDescription>1) The purpose of this modification is to:     a)Revise the language in Section V.C regarding the Merit Review Criteria Discussion. This section now reads:  Merit Review Criteria Discussion.   The section should be formatted to address each of the merit review criterion and  sub-criterion listed in Sections IV.A, for each Topic Area.  Provide sufficient information so that reviewers will be able to evaluate the application in accordance with these merit review criteria.  DOE WILL EVALUATE AND CONSIDER ONLY THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT ADDRESS SEPARATELY EACH OF THE MERIT REVIEW CRITERION AND SUB-CRITERION.  2) All other parts of the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) remain unchanged.  3) The areas which have changed are highlighted within the FOA.   The mission of DOE's Water Power Program is to perform and sponsor the necessary research, development, test, evaluation, and demonstration of innovative water power technologies, in order to effectively generate renewable, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective electricity from MHK resources.  Considering the early-stage of development of the industry and most MHK technologies, the Program will employ Technology Readiness Levels, or TRLs, as a means to assess the technical maturity of various types of marine and hydrokinetic water power technologies, in a consistent and uniform manner.   It is the intent of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) to advance the technical and operational readiness of marine and hydrokinetic systems and components across a range of TRLs, with the unified goal of accelerating the development and deployment of these technologies to provide a domestic source of clean, affordable energy that is both economical and ecologically respons  ible.  Federal funding for the Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) Technology Readiness Advancement Initiative for fiscal year 2010 is expected to be up to $15.36 million, with the possibility of continued funding at, or near, fiscal year 2010 levels for up to an additional two years.  This FOA seeks applications in the following Topic Areas:  Topic Area 1:  MHK Technologies Concept Development (TRLs 1-3)  Topic Area 2:  MHK Technology Readiness Level Advancement (TRLs 4-9)    Funding will be made available in each Topic Area for the advancement of both MHK "systems" and "components" as defined in the FOA.  For the purposes of this announcement, "device" will refer to the technology in question and can be either a system or component.   </FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>The goals of the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences (GSS) Program are:To promote scientific research in geography and the spatial sciences that advances theory and basic understanding and that addresses the challenges facing societyTo promote the integration of geographers and spatial scientists in interdisciplinary researchTo promote education and training of geographers and spatial scientists in order to enhance the capabilities of current and future generations of researchers To promote the development and use of scientific methods and tools for geographic researchThe Geography and Spatial Sciences Program sponsors research on the geographic distributions and interactions of human, physical, and biotic systems on the Earth's surface. Investigations are encouraged into the nature, causes, and consequences of human activity and natural environmental processes across a range of scales. Projects on a variety of topics (both domestic and international) qualify for support if they offer promise of contributing to scholarship by enhancing geographical knowledge, concepts, theories, methods, and their application to societal problems and concerns. GSS encourages projects that explicitly integrate undergraduate and graduate education into the overall research agenda.Proposals submitted for consideration by the Geography and Spatial Sciences Program at NSF tend to be most competitive if the research is grounded in relevant geographical theory, if it focuses on one or a few core questions grounded in the theoretical framework that has been established, if it articulates how scientifically sound methods will be used to explore the validity of answers to the core questions, and if the results are likely to contribute not only specific answers to those specific questions but also to the enhancement of broader geographic and/or spatial scientific theory.  The project can draw on and contribute to theory in other fields, too, but to obtain at least some funding from GSS, efforts should be made to enhance fundamental geographic theory, and the investigators should plan to disseminate their results through presentations and publications for geographers and spatial scientists as well as other relevant communities.GSS frequently engages in joint review of regular research proposals with other NSF programs.  Such joint review entails multiple programs coordinating the review of a single project proposal submitted to NSF.  Efforts are made to enable such joint review to provide &amp;quot;double opportunity&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;double jeopardy&amp;quot; for applicants, because a single program can provide support for proposed work it  finds meritorious even if other programs are not as enthusiastic about the proposed work.  Investigators who believe that their work might be appropriate for joint review are encouraged to contact program officers for all programs they think might have interest in their work well in advance of proposal-submission target dates or deadlines in order to assess whether joint review may be a viable option and to write their proposal accordingly.GSS conducts two competitions for regular research proposals each year.  Target dates for these competitions are January 15 and August 15.  While GSS program directors hope most proposals are submitted on or very close to those dates, they intend to include proposals submitted within two weeks following the target date of the competition.  Proposals submitted more than two weeks after the target date will be evaluated only if prior arrangements have been made with a GSS program director.  Note that the deadline dates listed on the &amp;quot;Due Dates&amp;quot; listing above do NOT apply to regular research proposals; those deadline dates identify strict deadlines for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) proposals.Related Funding OpportunitiesRelated funding opportunities are available for geographers, spatial scientists, and related scholars. For more information about these opportunities, visit the SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (SMA) webpage. Here, you will find a brief synopsis about other programs, as well as links guiding you to the appropriate program solicitations.Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) AwardsDoctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards are made by the Geography and Spatial Sciences program. Consult the SBE Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (DDRI) Grants solicitation and the Geography and Spatial Sciences DDRI specifics page.Proposal Submission GuidelinesRegular proposals submitted to the Geography and Spatial Sciences Program should be fully compliant with specifications in the Grant Proposal Guide (GPG). DDRI proposals should be prepared in accordance with the terms of the GPG except for the modifications specified in the SBE DDRI solicitation and the GSS DDRI specifics page.Proposal Review ProcessRegular proposals usually are sent to five or more outside reviewers and are evaluated by at least two members of the GSS Advisory Panel (18 eminent geographers and spatial scientists representing all major subfields). DDRI proposals are evaluated by three members of the DDRI Advisory Panel (18 panelists). All reviews and panel recommendations are advisory to the GSS program directors. Proposals normally will have at least three written reviews, which are forwarded (in anonymous form) with panel summaries to the PI.</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The Sociology Program supports basic research on all forms of human social organization -- societies, institutions, groups and demography -- and processes of individual and institutional change. The Program encourages theoretically focused empirical investigations aimed at improving the explanation of fundamental social processes. Included is research on organizations and organizational behavior, population dynamics, social movements, social groups, labor force participation, stratification and mobility, family, social networks, socialization, gender roles, and the sociology of science and technology. The Program supports both original data collections and secondary data analysis that use the full range of quantitative and qualitative methodological tools. Theoretically grounded projects that offer methodological innovations and improvements for data collection and analysis are also welcomed. Click here for information on &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/soc/sqrmii.jsp"&gt;Strengthening Qualitative Research through Methodological Innovation and Integration&lt;/a&gt;. The Sociology Program also funds doctoral dissertation research to defray direct costs associated with conducting research, for example, dataset acquisition, additional statistical or methodological training, meeting with scholars associated with original datasets, and fieldwork away from the student's home campus. See the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505118&amp;amp;org=SBE&amp;amp;from=home"&gt;Sociology ProgramDoctoral Dissertation Improvement Awards Solicitation&lt;/a&gt; for more information on this opportunity.  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Please Note: Principal Investigators should select PD 98-1331 in the program announcement/solicitation block on the proposal Cover Sheet for submission of regular research projects to the Sociology Program and NSF 14-604 for submission of Sociology Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement proposals. Projects are evaluated using the two Foundation-wide criteria, intrinsic merit and broader impacts. In assessing the intrinsic merit of proposed research, four components are key to securing support from the Sociology Program: (1) the issues investigated must be theoretically grounded; (2) the research should be based on empirical observation or be subject to empirical validation or illustration; (3) the research design must be appropriate to the questions asked; and (4) the proposed research must advance our understanding of social processes, structures and methods.  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;The NSF also offers a number of specialized funding opportunities through its crosscutting and cross-directorate activities; some of the Sociology related opportunities are listed below.  &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;Crosscutting Research &amp;amp; Training Opportunities:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ADVANCE: Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Education &amp;amp; Human Resources Program&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Graduate Research Fellowship Program&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) Program&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;SBE Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPRF)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Science of Learning Centers (SLC)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Science and Technology Centers: Integrative Partnerships&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  To get information about these programs and others, please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_list.jsp?type=xcut"&gt;Cross-cutting and NSF-wide Active Funding Opportunities&lt;/a&gt; homepage.</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>&lt;p class="style18"&gt;The primary objective of the Cultural Anthropology Program is to support basic scientific research on the causes, consequences, and complexities of human social and cultural variability. Anthropological research spans a wide gamut, and contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid. Recognizing the breadth of the field&amp;rsquo;s contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, theoretically engaged, and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation&amp;rsquo;s mandate is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice or applied policy. Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of:  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Socio-cultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization, and poverty&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Resilience and robustness of socio-cultural systems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Conflict, cooperation, and altruism&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Economy, culture, migration, and globalization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Cultural and social contexts of health and disease&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Social regulation, governmentality, and violence&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Origins of complexity in socio-cultural systems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Language and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics, and cognition&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Human variation through empirically grounded ethnographic descriptions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style18"&gt;Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, and integration of agent-based models with geographic information systems (GIS)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p class="style18"&gt;A. General Research The Cultural Anthropology Program supports a broad portfolio of research by both senior scholars and by graduate students. Information on recent awards can be found at the bottom of this page via the "What Has Been Funded" link. All proposals must be submitted using either Fastlane (as described in the Grant Proposal Guide) or Grants.gov. All proposals must explicitly address both the Intellectual Merit and the Broader Impacts of the research in the one-page project summary.  &lt;ol class="style18"&gt; &lt;li&gt;  The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIG) Program (see Solicitation &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505057&amp;amp;org=BCS&amp;amp;from=home"&gt;15-556&lt;/a&gt;) supports doctoral dissertation research by anthropology graduate students enrolled at U.S. institutions. Proposals are accepted for both the January 15 and the August 15 target dates. Grants are intended to support the extraordinary expenses of conducting research, not the normal daily expenses of graduate education.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Senior proposals support individual, team, or collaborative research by scholars who hold a PhD, or other equivalent or appropriate credential. Proposals are accepted for both the January 15 and the August 15 target dates. Senior proposal project descriptions may be up to 15, single-spaced pages. There is no ceiling on senior proposal budgets, but a typical award rarely exceeds $100,000 per year of the award, including indirect costs. Researchers may propose empirically grounded and theoretically engaged projects in any sub-field and theoretical area of cultural anthropology.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  General guidelines. All researchers should take care to explain very clearly why the research is needed; what it will contribute to the scientific understanding of human society and culture; and how it will lead to the development of theory extending beyond the particular cases to be investigated. They should be clear about the question or questions that the research is addressing; how the research design will address those questions; what information or data will be collected, how, and why; and how the information or data will be analyzed to address the research questions. Finally, researchers should also explain why they are able to conduct the research successfully. A good research proposal is interesting, clear, explicit, tightly integrated, and confidence inspiring.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p class="style14"&gt;B. Other Programs   &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li class="style14"&gt;  The Faculty Scholars Program (see Solicitation &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5321&amp;amp;org=BCS"&gt;07-544&lt;/a&gt;) supports methodological training for cultural anthropologists who wish to learn new skills that are needed as part of an ongoing research program. For example, support may be requested to learn new methods of cross-cultural research, demography, remote sensing and GIS, ecological field survey, linguistics, or modeling. Support may be requested to learn any methodological skill that is necessary to advance the scholar's research agenda, as justified in the proposal with reference to published results from prior work. Proposals are accepted for both the January 16 and the August 16 target dates. Normal proposal guidelines apply. Awards are for up to 12 months and for a maximum of $50,000.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style14"&gt;  Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) and EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER). The RAPID funding mechanism is used for proposals having a severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to data, facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events. The EAGER funding mechanism may be used to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This work may be considered especially "high risk-high payoff" in the sense that it, for example, involves radically different approaches, applies new expertise, or engages novel disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives. For detailed information concerning these two types of grants, please review Chapter II.D of the NSF Grant Proposal Guide &lt;a href="http://nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg"&gt;(http://nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg)&lt;/a&gt;. There are no deadlines or target dates associated with these types of awards and the Cultural Anthropology program funding limit for them is $25,000 including direct costs.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style14"&gt;  Research Experience for Graduate Students (REG) and Reserch Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Supplements. (see &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14031/nsf14031.jsp?org=NSF"&gt;Dear Colleague Letter NSF 14-031&lt;/a&gt;). Senior PIs with current NSF awards, may request supplements to support closely mentored but independent research projects by undergraduates intending to pursue graduate work in anthropology or graduate students at the pre-dissertation phase of their education. The supplement request should include a two to three-page description of the project to be undertaken, the qualifications of the student, and the plan for mentoring. PIs are encouraged to submit proposals by March 1, each spring, although they will be considered at other times, as well. Awards are limited to $5000 for REGs and $4000 for REUs.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style14"&gt;  Workshops. Workshops are sometimes needed to allow researchers to work together. Proposals for workshops with research goals may be submitted in the normal grant cycle (target dates: January 15 and August 15). Under exceptional circumstances and with prior permission from the Program Officer, workshop proposals may be considered out of cycle, as well.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style14"&gt;  Training Programs. The Cultural Anthropology Program supports the dissemination of the most current research tools available for social science research. Consequently, as budget permits, the Cultural Anthropology Program funds a limited number of proposals for training workshops, short courses, and fieldwork programs, through the regular proposal review cycle. For more information, please contact the Program Officer.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="style14"&gt;  Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Grants. The Cultural Anthropology Program participates in this NSF-wide activity offering prestigious awards in support of the early development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers. Consult the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214"&gt;CAREER solicitation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;!-- InstanceEndEditable --&gt;&lt;!--  end content --&gt;</FundingOppDescription>

        <FundingOppDescription>The goal of the Archaeology Program is to fund research which furthers anthropologically relevant archaeological knowledge. In accordance with the National Science Foundation&amp;rsquo;s mission such research has the potential to provide fundamental scientific insight. While within the broad range of &amp;ldquo;archaeology&amp;rdquo; the focus is on projects judged to be significant from an anthropological perspective, the Program sets no priorities based on time period, geographic region or specific research topic. The Program administers four competitions each of which is described below. It also supports projects submitted under NSF-wide competition guidelines. These include CAREER, EAGER, RAPID and Research Experiences for Undergraduates Supplement requests.   Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards (DDRI)   For a detailed description of the Archaeology Program DDRI competition, see Solicitation NSF 14-566 which can be accessed via the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505076&amp;amp;org=BCS&amp;amp;from=home"&gt;Archaeology DDRI web site&lt;/a&gt;. It contains additional rules not presented in this synopsis. The DDRI competition provides up to $20,000 (+ university indirect/overhead costs) to permit graduate students enrolled in US universities to conduct dissertation research. The student need not be a US citizen or national. While the student writes the proposal and conducts/supervises the research, the dissertation advisor serves as the Principal Investigator and the student is listed as the co-PI. Salary and normal living expenses are not eligible costs but per diem and most other research expenses are allowable. Both field and non-field projects are funded. Proposals may be submitted at any time and applicants are normally informally notified of the likely outcome within three months. Applications are sent for evaluation to six individuals (&amp;ldquo;ad hoc reviewers&amp;rdquo;) specifically selected for subject matter expertise. Students are allowed to resubmit one time if their original proposal is declined.   Senior Archaeological Research   The Archaeology Program holds a twice yearly competition to provide support for senior investigator archaeological research. The target dates, as noted above, are July 1 and December 20. (In contrast to &amp;ldquo;deadlines&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;target dates&amp;rdquo; permit leeway as determined by the Program Director.) Each proposal is sent to a set of ad hoc reviewers and is also evaluated together with the other applications submitted in that round by a broadly based panel of anthropological archaeologists. Grants are normally two to three years in duration. In the US Government fiscal year 2014 (FY14), the average award (including both direct and indirect costs) was approximately $178,000 with individual grants ranging from $48,872 to $349,964 in size.   Archaeometry Research Awards   The Archaeology Program administers an annual &amp;ldquo;archaeometry&amp;rdquo; competition with a target date of December 1. The goal is to fund projects either to develop/refine anthropologically relevant archaeometric techniques and/or support laboratories which provide relevant services. Examples of the former include the development of methods to identify specific types of organic residues on ceramics and sample pre-treatment techniques for radiocarbon analysis. Service laboratories which, for example provide trace element, isotopic and dendrochronological analyses illustrate the latter. Projects which apply standard archaeometic techniques with the goal to answer specific archaeological questions should be submitted to the &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; archaeology competition. Data archives, in common with archaeometric laboratories, function to strengthen basic archaeological infrastructure. Therefore, Principal Investigators may submit proposals through the archaeometry competition to assist in meeting this goal. Proposals are evaluated by both ad hoc reviewers and a panel composed of individuals who combine both archaeological and archaeometric expertise. Awards (including indirect costs) are normally two to three years in duration and in FY14 ranged from $89,868 to $207,879 in size. The average award was $179,120.   &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;High Risk Research in Biological Anthropology and/or Archaeology (HRRBAA)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(See Solicitation NSF 08-523 which can be accessed via the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5319&amp;amp;org=BCS&amp;amp;from=home"&gt;HRRBAA program web site&lt;/a&gt;.)   This competition is designed to permit the submission of high-risk, exploratory proposals that can lead to significant new anthropological knowledge. Because of a highly competitive environment, proposals that have both a high risk of failure and the potential for significant payoffs are less able to compete with standard research proposals. This program is designed to provide a mechanism whereby risky proposals with a great potential for advancement of the discipline can compete for funding. The risk involved in such endeavors must significantly exceed that associated with regular archaeology research projects. &amp;ldquo;Risk&amp;rdquo; in this context refers to risk of project failure and not risk of site destruction. The competition is also not intended to provide &amp;ldquo;start-up&amp;rdquo; grants. Maximum awards are limited to $35,000 in total cost and proposals may be submitted at any time. They are evaluated by ad hoc reviewers only. In FY14 the Program funded a single award of $34,090.   &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;NSF Required Data Management Plan&lt;/span&gt;   All proposals must include as a supplementary document a plan for data management and sharing the products of research. The data-management plan to be submitted with a proposal must be no longer than two (2) pages in length.   This supplementary document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results. For more information about this requirement, please see the Grant Proposal Guide, Chapter II.C.2.j and the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmpfaqs.jsp"&gt;Data Management and Sharing Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs)&lt;/a&gt;.

Questions should be addressed to John Yellen via e-mail (&lt;a href="mailto:jyellen@nsf.gov"&gt;jyellen@nsf.gov&lt;/a&gt;).   While the Archaeology Program does not sponsor, endorse or have an official arrangement with any data archive it would note that two organizations provide this service.  &lt;ul type="disc"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open Context &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://opencontext.org/"&gt;http://opencontext.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://opencontext.org/about/publishing"&gt;http://opencontext.org/about/publishing&lt;/a&gt;.
