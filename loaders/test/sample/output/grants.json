The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), announces its interest in supporting conferences through the AHRQ Conference Grant Program. AHRQ seeks to support conferences that help to further its mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. The types of conferences eligible for support include: \n\n1) Research development - conferences where issues or challenges in the practice and delivery of health care are defined and a research agenda or strategy for studying them is developed; \n\n2) Research design and methodology - conferences where methodological and technical issues of major importance in the field of health services research are addressed or new designs and methodologies are developed; \n\n3) Dissemination and implementation conferences  conferences where research findings and evidence-based information and tools are summarized, communicated and used by organizations and individuals that have the capability to use the information to improve the outcomes, quality, access to, and cost and utilization of health care services; and/or, \n\n4) Research training, infrastructure and career development - conferences where faculty, trainees and students are brought together with stakeholders to develop, share or disseminate research products, experiences, curricula, syllabi, training competencies.  These types of conferences are not for the training of individuals in health services research.","grants.gov_CFDANumber_t":"93.226","grants.gov_EligibilityCategory_t":"25","grants.gov_AdditionalEligibilityInfo_t":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:\n Eligible Agencies of the Federal Government; Faith-based or Community-based Organizations; Indian/Native American Tribal Governments (Other than Federally Recognized).","grants.gov_CostSharing_t":"N","grants.gov_ObtainFundingOppText_t":"http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-13-017.html","AgencyContact_t":"NIH OER Webmaster\nFBOWebmaster@OD.NIH.GOV","listing_url":"http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=206094"}

The objective of the FOA is to accelerate the development of innovative pharmacological treatments through support of early phase human clinical testing.  FIH pharmacology studies should assess target engagement, pharmacological effects, safety, and tolerability of novel compounds in order to build a pipeline for initial POC or efficacy trials in patients. POC studies of novel compounds should use pharmacologically based dosing, with assessment of target engagement and evaluation of the impact of compounds on clinically relevant physiological systems as well as clinical indicators of effect. The overall objective is to facilitate rapid collection of data to \"de-risk\" novel mechanism of action or combination treatments and to attract private funding for further clinical and commercial development of candidate medications. Partnerships between academia and industry are strongly encouraged.","grants.gov_CFDANumber_t":"93.242","grants.gov_EligibilityCategory_t":"25","grants.gov_AdditionalEligibilityInfo_t":"Other Eligible Applicants include the following:\n Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions; Eligible Agencies of the Federal Government; Faith-based or Community-based Organizations; Hispanic-serving Institutions; Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); Indian/Native American Tribal Governments (Other than Federally Recognized); Regional Organizations; Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) ; U.S. Territory or Possession; Non-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.\nNon-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations are not eligible to apply.\n\nForeign components, as defined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement, are allowed.","grants.gov_CostSharing_t":"N","grants.gov_ObtainFundingOppText_t":"http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-12-007.html","AgencyContact_t":"NIH OER Webmaster\nFBOWebmaster@OD.NIH.GOV","listing_url":"http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=130033"}
