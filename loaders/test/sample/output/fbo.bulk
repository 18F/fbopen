The 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW) is requesting information and conducting market research to determine if there are potential sources which have the capability to provide security services at the 505 CCW and its subordinate units. This announcement closes 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, 6 Jan 2014. The Government is seeking industry input from all sources (small and large businesses) at this time. Small Business concerns are highly encouraged to respond to this request in order for the Government to determine if this acquisition should be a total small business set aside under the auspices of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 561621 (Alarm System Monitoring Services) with a corresponding size standard of $19M. Interested parties must be registered under NAICS 561621 in SAM (System for Award Management) at www.sam.gov, formerly known as CCR (Central Contractor Registration).
