For more information, see the DCL on SusChEM (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2013/nsf13013/nsf13013.pdf), a new NSF Emphasis Area.\"  The Chemical Catalysis Program supports experimental and theoretical research directed towards the fundamental understanding of the chemistry of catalytic processes at the molecular level. The Program accepts proposals on catalytic approaches, which facilitate, direct, and accelerate efficient chemical transformations. This includes the design and synthesis of catalytic species on the molecular, supramolecular, and nanometer scales as well as studies of the dynamics of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. Processes of interest include (but are not limited to): polymerization catalysis, single site catalysis, and biologically-inspired catalysis. Applications of modeling, theory, and simulation to catalytic processes are also relevant. Fundamental studies of energy-related catalytic processes, CO2 conversion, electrocatalysis (such as in water splitting and fuel cells), and photocatalysis (such as in solar energy conversion) are welcome in the program.  Submissions that address national needs for sustainability are particularly encouraged. Examples of sustainable chemistry appropriate for the Chemical Catalysis Program include: 1) the design, preparation and reactivity studies associated with new catalysts and catalytic processes that will replace rare, expensive and/or toxic compounds or nanomaterials with earth abundant, inexpensive and benign alternatives; 2) new chemistries to economically recycle chemicals that cannot be replaced, such as phosphorus and the rare earth elements; 3) new chemistries to convert non-petroleum based sources of organics to feedstock chemicals; and 4) new environmentally-friendly chemical reactions and processes that require less energy, fresh water, and/or organic solvents than current practice.  Investigators are urged to read more about NSF efforts in encouraging sustainable synthesis, and the use and reuse of chemicals and materials in the Dear Colleague Letter on SusChEM: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12097/nsf12097.jsp?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&WT.mc_ev=click.\"  The Program does not support applied catalysis research that focuses on scale-up, processing, transport dynamics, long-term stability and other engineering aspects of catalysis. The Program also does not support biocatalysis research with purely biological enzymes and cellular systems. Catalytic research whose immediate objectives are the synthesis of complex natural products using established catalysts should be submitted to the Chemical Synthesis program.","listing_url":"http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=48430"}

Emphasis is on research strongly grounded in theory. Central research topics for consideration by the Perception, Action, and Cognition panel include vision, audition, haptics, attention, memory, reasoning, written and spoken discourse, and motor control. The program encompasses a wide range of theoretical perspectives, such as symbolic computation, connectionism, ecological, nonlinear dynamics, and complex systems, and a variety of methodologies including both experimental studies and modeling. The PAC program is open to co-review of proposals submitted to other programs (e.g., Linguistics, Developmental and Learning Sciences, Cognitive Neuroscience, etc). Proposals may involve clinical populations, animals, or computational modeling only if the work has direct impact on basic issues of human perception, action, or cognition.  Within one week of receipt of the proposal number from FastLane, each PI must send the following two documents via email to sbe-pac@nsf.gov. The subject heading of the email should note the proposal number and the Principal Investigator. Attach the following documents prepared on the following templates.  An Excel spreadsheet with two worksheet pages that will be used by NSF to check for conflicts of interest in assembling the review community.(Excel Template for PAC).A single PowerPoint slide with (a) name and affiliation of all senior personnel, (b) title of your proposal, and (c) a very brief (1-3 sentences at most) summary of the main hypotheses and methods. The slide may only include graphs, images, or other illustrations if they appear in the proposal. You must use the template (PowerPoint Templatefor PAC) and name the file with the PI'slast namefollowed by the seven digitproposal number(e.g., Smith 127999). This will be used during review panel discussions. Remember to email these two documents to: sbe-pac@nsf.gov; do not use FastLane.

In accordance with the National Science Foundation’s mission such research has the potential to provide fundamental scientific insight. While within the broad range of “archaeology” the focus is on projects judged to be significant from an anthropological perspective, the Program sets no priorities based on time period, geographic region or specific research topic. The Program administers four competitions each of which is described below. It also supports projects submitted under NSF-wide competition guidelines. These include CAREER, EAGER, RAPID and Research Experiences for Undergraduates Supplement requests.   Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards (DDRI)   For a detailed description of the Archaeology Program DDRI competition, see Solicitation NSF 14-566 which can be accessed via the Archaeology DDRI web site. It contains additional rules not presented in this synopsis. The DDRI competition provides up to $20,000 (+ university indirect/overhead costs) to permit graduate students enrolled in US universities to conduct dissertation research. The student need not be a US citizen or national. While the student writes the proposal and conducts/supervises the research, the dissertation advisor serves as the Principal Investigator and the student is listed as the co-PI. Salary and normal living expenses are not eligible costs but per diem and most other research expenses are allowable. Both field and non-field projects are funded. Proposals may be submitted at any time and applicants are normally informally notified of the likely outcome within three months. Applications are sent for evaluation to six individuals (“ad hoc reviewers”) specifically selected for subject matter expertise. Students are allowed to resubmit one time if their original proposal is declined.   Senior Archaeological Research   The Archaeology Program holds a twice yearly competition to provide support for senior investigator archaeological research. The target dates, as noted above, are July 1 and December 20. (In contrast to “deadlines”, “target dates” permit leeway as determined by the Program Director.) Each proposal is sent to a set of ad hoc reviewers and is also evaluated together with the other applications submitted in that round by a broadly based panel of anthropological archaeologists. Grants are normally two to three years in duration. In the US Government fiscal year 2014 (FY14), the average award (including both direct and indirect costs) was approximately $178,000 with individual grants ranging from $48,872 to $349,964 in size.   Archaeometry Research Awards   The Archaeology Program administers an annual “archaeometry” competition with a target date of December 1. The goal is to fund projects either to develop/refine anthropologically relevant archaeometric techniques and/or support laboratories which provide relevant services. Examples of the former include the development of methods to identify specific types of organic residues on ceramics and sample pre-treatment techniques for radiocarbon analysis. Service laboratories which, for example provide trace element, isotopic and dendrochronological analyses illustrate the latter. Projects which apply standard archaeometic techniques with the goal to answer specific archaeological questions should be submitted to the “senior” archaeology competition. Data archives, in common with archaeometric laboratories, function to strengthen basic archaeological infrastructure. Therefore, Principal Investigators may submit proposals through the archaeometry competition to assist in meeting this goal. Proposals are evaluated by both ad hoc reviewers and a panel composed of individuals who combine both archaeological and archaeometric expertise. Awards (including indirect costs) are normally two to three years in duration and in FY14 ranged from $89,868 to $207,879 in size. The average award was $179,120.   High Risk Research in Biological Anthropology and/or Archaeology (HRRBAA)\n(See Solicitation NSF 08-523 which can be accessed via the HRRBAA program web site.)   This competition is designed to permit the submission of high-risk, exploratory proposals that can lead to significant new anthropological knowledge. Because of a highly competitive environment, proposals that have both a high risk of failure and the potential for significant payoffs are less able to compete with standard research proposals. This program is designed to provide a mechanism whereby risky proposals with a great potential for advancement of the discipline can compete for funding. The risk involved in such endeavors must significantly exceed that associated with regular archaeology research projects. “Risk” in this context refers to risk of project failure and not risk of site destruction. The competition is also not intended to provide “start-up” grants. Maximum awards are limited to $35,000 in total cost and proposals may be submitted at any time. They are evaluated by ad hoc reviewers only. In FY14 the Program funded a single award of $34,090.   NSF Required Data Management Plan   All proposals must include as a supplementary document a plan for data management and sharing the products of research. The data-management plan to be submitted with a proposal must be no longer than two (2) pages in length.   This supplementary document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results. For more information about this requirement, please see the Grant Proposal Guide, Chapter II.C.2.j and the Data Management and Sharing Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs). Please note: the SBE Directorate has additional guidance for proposals submitted to SBE programs, please see Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards. Questions should be addressed to John Yellen via e-mail (jyellen@nsf.gov).   While the Archaeology Program does not sponsor, endorse or have an official arrangement with any data archive it would note that two organizations provide this service.   Open Context http://opencontext.org and http://opencontext.org/about/publishing. One may contact Open Context's Editor publish@opencontext.org for further information.   The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR; http://www.tdar.org). One may contact Francis P. McManamon, Executive Director of Digital Authority (480-965-6510; fpmcmanamon@digitalantiquity) who maintains and develops tDAR.   In addition to the NSF guidance, you may find the guidance provided by the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) helpful. Additional resources can be found at the SAA site.   When necessary, applicants may request funds to implement a data management plan.
