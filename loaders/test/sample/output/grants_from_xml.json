The Program accepts proposals on catalytic approaches, which facilitate, direct, and accelerate efficient chemical transformations. This includes the design and synthesis of catalytic species on the molecular, supramolecular, and nanometer scales as well as studies of the dynamics of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. Processes of interest include (but are not limited to): polymerization catalysis, single site catalysis, and biologically-inspired catalysis. Applications of modeling, theory, and simulation to catalytic processes are also relevant. Fundamental studies of energy-related catalytic processes, CO2 conversion, electrocatalysis (such as in water splitting and fuel cells), and photocatalysis (such as in solar energy conversion) are welcome in the program.  Submissions that address national needs for sustainability are particularly encouraged. Examples of sustainable chemistry appropriate for the Chemical Catalysis Program include: 1) the design, preparation and reactivity studies associated with new catalysts and catalytic processes that will replace rare, expensive and/or toxic compounds or nanomaterials with earth abundant, inexpensive and benign alternatives; 2) new chemistries to economically recycle chemicals that cannot be replaced, such as phosphorus and the rare earth elements; 3) new chemistries to convert non-petroleum based sources of organics to feedstock chemicals; and 4) new environmentally-friendly chemical reactions and processes that require less energy, fresh water, and/or organic solvents than current practice.  Investigators are urged to read more about NSF efforts in encouraging sustainable synthesis, and the use and reuse of chemicals and materials in the Dear Colleague Letter on SusChEM: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12097/nsf12097.jsp?WT.mc_id=USNSF_25&WT.mc_ev=click.\"  The Program does not support applied catalysis research that focuses on scale-up, processing, transport dynamics, long-term stability and other engineering aspects of catalysis. The Program also does not support biocatalysis research with purely biological enzymes and cellular systems.

Anthropological research spans a wide gamut, and contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid. Recognizing the breadth of the field’s contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, theoretically engaged, and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation’s mandate is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice or applied policy. Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of:   Socio-cultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization, and poverty Resilience and robustness of socio-cultural systems Conflict, cooperation, and altruism Economy, culture, migration, and globalization Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices Cultural and social contexts of health and disease Social regulation, governmentality, and violence Origins of complexity in socio-cultural systems Language and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics, and cognition Human variation through empirically grounded ethnographic descriptions Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, and integration of agent-based models with geographic information systems (GIS)  A. General Research The Cultural Anthropology Program supports a broad portfolio of research by both senior scholars and by graduate students. Information on recent awards can be found at the bottom of this page via the \"What Has Been Funded\" link. All proposals must be submitted using either Fastlane (as described in the Grant Proposal Guide) or Grants.gov. All proposals must explicitly address both the Intellectual Merit and the Broader Impacts of the research in the one-page project summary.     The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIG) Program (see Solicitation 15-556) supports doctoral dissertation research by anthropology graduate students enrolled at U.S. institutions. Proposals are accepted for both the January 15 and the August 15 target dates. Grants are intended to support the extraordinary expenses of conducting research, not the normal daily expenses of graduate education.     Senior proposals support individual, team, or collaborative research by scholars who hold a PhD, or other equivalent or appropriate credential. Proposals are accepted for both the January 15 and the August 15 target dates. Senior proposal project descriptions may be up to 15, single-spaced pages. There is no ceiling on senior proposal budgets, but a typical award rarely exceeds $100,000 per year of the award, including indirect costs. Researchers may propose empirically grounded and theoretically engaged projects in any sub-field and theoretical area of cultural anthropology.     General guidelines. All researchers should take care to explain very clearly why the research is needed; what it will contribute to the scientific understanding of human society and culture; and how it will lead to the development of theory extending beyond the particular cases to be investigated. They should be clear about the question or questions that the research is addressing; how the research design will address those questions; what information or data will be collected, how, and why; and how the information or data will be analyzed to address the research questions. Finally, researchers should also explain why they are able to conduct the research successfully. A good research proposal is interesting, clear, explicit, tightly integrated, and confidence inspiring.    B. Other Programs      The Faculty Scholars Program (see Solicitation 07-544) supports methodological training for cultural anthropologists who wish to learn new skills that are needed as part of an ongoing research program. For example, support may be requested to learn new methods of cross-cultural research, demography, remote sensing and GIS, ecological field survey, linguistics, or modeling. Support may be requested to learn any methodological skill that is necessary to advance the scholar's research agenda, as justified in the proposal with reference to published results from prior work. Proposals are accepted for both the January 16 and the August 16 target dates. Normal proposal guidelines apply. Awards are for up to 12 months and for a maximum of $50,000.     Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) and EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER). The RAPID funding mechanism is used for proposals having a severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to data, facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events. The EAGER funding mechanism may be used to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches. This work may be considered especially \"high risk-high payoff\" in the sense that it, for example, involves radically different approaches, applies new expertise, or engages novel disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives. For detailed information concerning these two types of grants, please review Chapter II.D of the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (http://nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?gpg). There are no deadlines or target dates associated with these types of awards and the Cultural Anthropology program funding limit for them is $25,000 including direct costs.     Research Experience for Graduate Students (REG) and Reserch Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Supplements. (see Dear Colleague Letter NSF 14-031). Senior PIs with current NSF awards, may request supplements to support closely mentored but independent research projects by undergraduates intending to pursue graduate work in anthropology or graduate students at the pre-dissertation phase of their education. The supplement request should include a two to three-page description of the project to be undertaken, the qualifications of the student, and the plan for mentoring. PIs are encouraged to submit proposals by March 1, each spring, although they will be considered at other times, as well. Awards are limited to $5000 for REGs and $4000 for REUs.     Workshops. Workshops are sometimes needed to allow researchers to work together. Proposals for workshops with research goals may be submitted in the normal grant cycle (target dates: January 15 and August 15). Under exceptional circumstances and with prior permission from the Program Officer, workshop proposals may be considered out of cycle, as well.     Training Programs. The Cultural Anthropology Program supports the dissemination of the most current research tools available for social science research. Consequently, as budget permits, the Cultural Anthropology Program funds a limited number of proposals for training workshops, short courses, and fieldwork programs, through the regular proposal review cycle. For more information, please contact the Program Officer.     Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Grants. The Cultural Anthropology Program participates in this NSF-wide activity offering prestigious awards in support of the early development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers. Consult the CAREER solicitation for more information.     ","listing_url":"http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=45592"}

In accordance with the National Science Foundation’s mission such research has the potential to provide fundamental scientific insight. While within the broad range of “archaeology” the focus is on projects judged to be significant from an anthropological perspective, the Program sets no priorities based on time period, geographic region or specific research topic. The Program administers four competitions each of which is described below. It also supports projects submitted under NSF-wide competition guidelines. These include CAREER, EAGER, RAPID and Research Experiences for Undergraduates Supplement requests.   Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Awards (DDRI)   For a detailed description of the Archaeology Program DDRI competition, see Solicitation NSF 14-566 which can be accessed via the Archaeology DDRI web site. It contains additional rules not presented in this synopsis. The DDRI competition provides up to $20,000 (+ university indirect/overhead costs) to permit graduate students enrolled in US universities to conduct dissertation research. The student need not be a US citizen or national. While the student writes the proposal and conducts/supervises the research, the dissertation advisor serves as the Principal Investigator and the student is listed as the co-PI. Salary and normal living expenses are not eligible costs but per diem and most other research expenses are allowable. Both field and non-field projects are funded. Proposals may be submitted at any time and applicants are normally informally notified of the likely outcome within three months. Applications are sent for evaluation to six individuals (“ad hoc reviewers”) specifically selected for subject matter expertise. Students are allowed to resubmit one time if their original proposal is declined.   Senior Archaeological Research   The Archaeology Program holds a twice yearly competition to provide support for senior investigator archaeological research. The target dates, as noted above, are July 1 and December 20. (In contrast to “deadlines”, “target dates” permit leeway as determined by the Program Director.) Each proposal is sent to a set of ad hoc reviewers and is also evaluated together with the other applications submitted in that round by a broadly based panel of anthropological archaeologists. Grants are normally two to three years in duration. In the US Government fiscal year 2014 (FY14), the average award (including both direct and indirect costs) was approximately $178,000 with individual grants ranging from $48,872 to $349,964 in size.   Archaeometry Research Awards   The Archaeology Program administers an annual “archaeometry” competition with a target date of December 1. The goal is to fund projects either to develop/refine anthropologically relevant archaeometric techniques and/or support laboratories which provide relevant services. Examples of the former include the development of methods to identify specific types of organic residues on ceramics and sample pre-treatment techniques for radiocarbon analysis. Service laboratories which, for example provide trace element, isotopic and dendrochronological analyses illustrate the latter. Projects which apply standard archaeometic techniques with the goal to answer specific archaeological questions should be submitted to the “senior” archaeology competition. Data archives, in common with archaeometric laboratories, function to strengthen basic archaeological infrastructure. Therefore, Principal Investigators may submit proposals through the archaeometry competition to assist in meeting this goal. Proposals are evaluated by both ad hoc reviewers and a panel composed of individuals who combine both archaeological and archaeometric expertise. Awards (including indirect costs) are normally two to three years in duration and in FY14 ranged from $89,868 to $207,879 in size. The average award was $179,120.   High Risk Research in Biological Anthropology and/or Archaeology (HRRBAA)\n(See Solicitation NSF 08-523 which can be accessed via the HRRBAA program web site.)   This competition is designed to permit the submission of high-risk, exploratory proposals that can lead to significant new anthropological knowledge. Because of a highly competitive environment, proposals that have both a high risk of failure and the potential for significant payoffs are less able to compete with standard research proposals. This program is designed to provide a mechanism whereby risky proposals with a great potential for advancement of the discipline can compete for funding. The risk involved in such endeavors must significantly exceed that associated with regular archaeology research projects. “Risk” in this context refers to risk of project failure and not risk of site destruction. The competition is also not intended to provide “start-up” grants. Maximum awards are limited to $35,000 in total cost and proposals may be submitted at any time. They are evaluated by ad hoc reviewers only. In FY14 the Program funded a single award of $34,090.   NSF Required Data Management Plan   All proposals must include as a supplementary document a plan for data management and sharing the products of research. The data-management plan to be submitted with a proposal must be no longer than two (2) pages in length.   This supplementary document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results. For more information about this requirement, please see the Grant Proposal Guide, Chapter II.C.2.j and the Data Management and Sharing Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs). Please note: the SBE Directorate has additional guidance for proposals submitted to SBE programs, please see Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards. Questions should be addressed to John Yellen via e-mail (jyellen@nsf.gov).   While the Archaeology Program does not sponsor, endorse or have an official arrangement with any data archive it would note that two organizations provide this service.   Open Context http://opencontext.org and http://opencontext.org/about/publishing. One may contact Open Context's Editor publish@opencontext.org for further information.   The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR; http://www.tdar.org). One may contact Francis P. McManamon, Executive Director of Digital Authority (480-965-6510; fpmcmanamon@digitalantiquity) who maintains and develops tDAR.   In addition to the NSF guidance, you may find the guidance provided by the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) helpful. Additional resources can be found at the SAA site.   When necessary, applicants may request funds to implement a data management plan.
